# Github actions

```bash 
// In the .github/workflows/node.js.yml  file 

publish 
    needs : job-name 


# publish is not a native GitHub Actions keyword â€” it's usually a custom job name or step name in a workflow that is responsible for publishing something. This could mean:

# Publishing a package to npm, Docker Hub, PyPI, etc.

# Uploading build artifacts.

# Deploying to a server or cloud (e.g., AWS, Vercel, Firebase).


# needs is a GitHub Actions keyword that declares job dependencies. It tells GitHub:
# "Don't start this job until the specified job(s) finish successfully."

```

# Advantages : 
It lets us automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying your code whenever a specific event occurs (e.g., code push, pull request, release).
